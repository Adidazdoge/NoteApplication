## **Target Market**
If marketed, **60 Days to Survive** would appeal to fans of text-based strategy games, particularly those who enjoy post-apocalyptic survival scenarios. The game is suitable for players seeking a challenging, story-driven experience with resource management and decision-making elements. It would also attract hobbyists interested in games designed with Clean Architecture, as well as students learning about modular software design.

In addition, the game could target casual gamers who prefer low-intensity, text-based gameplay that doesn't require high-end hardware. By maintaining simplicity in its user interface and gameplay, the game can cater to a diverse audience, including those new to the strategy or survival genres.

## **Potential Demographic Barriers**
The program might be less accessible to players with certain disabilities, such as visual impairments, due to its reliance on a text-based interface. Future updates could incorporate accessibility features like text-to-speech or screen reader support to mitigate this issue. Additionally, the gameâ€™s English-only interface might limit access for non-English speakers.
